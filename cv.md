3. Seeing how fast the Internet is developing, as well as observing the growing demand for qualified specialists in this field, I decided to change my specialty and start a new career. I think this decision is more balanced and my new profession will be in demand for many years and will bring me a decent income, which will push me to constantly study and master new programming languages.
4. Familiar with programming JS, HTML, CSS

```javascript

    for (let i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
        sum += (TriangSum += i);}
        return sum;
}
